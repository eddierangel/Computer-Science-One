## Why learn to code computers?


## Computer Organization

A computer is a collection of several types of electonric devices. When we think of what a computer is we may envision a laptop or desktop of one of the major computer manufactures. A computer is more complex the most folks initially realize. A computer consists of devices that provide input and output capaiblities as well as the ability to store its electronic products suchs as documents and music files. 

Input: 
Keyboard Mouse Scanner Webcam

Output: 
Monitor Projector Printer


Processors are also known as Central Processing Units or CPU for short. A CPU actually consists of multiple components, the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) and the Control Unit (CU). In modern computing, there are two type of processors, the Complex Instruction Set Computers (CISC) and  Reduced Instruction Set Computers (RISC) Processors.


There are two types of storage that modern computers contain, volatile and non-volatile memory. Volatile memory requires an electrical charge to keep and hold the data within its storage areas. A computers RAM is a type of volatile memory. We understand that if we do not save our work and our computer restarts we lose the contents of the work that was not saved. 

Memory locations are represented as hexadecimal values. The lowest memory location on a 32-bit computer is 0x00000000 and its highest location is 0xFFFFFFFF. 

That working data exists within the computers volatile memory. 

Storage
Volatile Memory: Random Access Memory
Non-Volatile Memory: Hard disc drives 




## Programming Languages
Computing Devices understand their own unique langue that is typically dependent
on its hardware. This unique language is referred to as its Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). Just as humans use language to communicate so do computing devices. Human language has evolved over time and over geogrphaical areas. We can see and hear similarities and diffrences in languages such as Italtian, Spanish and French. However, if we see languages such as Arabic or Sanskrit we may not see any similarities. 

This is how we can view a computers language, its ISA. In order to provide a more readable and writable set of instructions for the various types of computer architecture there exist different types of computer languages that have a history that spans decades, maybe even centuries. These languages evolve over time in order to add functionality and features along with fixing or resolving any issues that may have previously existed. 

Machine Language: Machine Dependent
Assembly Language: Machine Dependent
High-level Language: Human Readable and Writeble


## What is a Program?
A program is a set or collection of statements or instructions that a computing device processes so that it can perform as designed. Programs vary in size and scope. Meaning that some programs are written in a few lines of code whereas other programs take millions of lines. This is comparable to novels and stories that can take up hundreds of pages to thousands of pages. 

A programmer is a person whose primary responsiblity is to develop a program based up the specifications outlined after an initial analysis and design period. The goal or end result of a program is to accomplish the specific tasks that were determined and outlined. These goals or items are typically refered to as features or a programs feature set. 

An example of a simple program is calculator whose primary responsiblity would bet to carry out mathmatical tasks and calculations. A word processor program would be an example of a complex program whose feature set include formating text and inserting images into an electronic document. 

The main entry point of a program is typically a fucntion we define as main. 



## Software Development Lifecycle

Phase I: 
The initial steps that a programmer take are analysis, design, and the write code.

Phase II: 
Preprocess

Phase III: 
Compile

Phase IV: 
Link

Phase V: 
Load

Phase VI: 
Execute
