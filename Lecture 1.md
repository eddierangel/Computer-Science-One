## Programming as a Language
Computing Devices understand their own unique langue that is typically dependent
on its hardware. This unique language is referred to as its Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). Just as humans use language to communicate so do computing devices. Human language has evolved over time and over geogrphaical areas. We can see and hear similarities and diffrences in languages such as Italtian, Spanish and French. However, if we see languages such as Arabic or Sanskrit we may not see any similarities. 

This is how we can view a computers language, its ISA. In order to provide a more readable and writable set of instructions for the various types of computer architecture there exist different types of computer languages that have a history that spans decades, maybe even centuries. These languages evolve over time in order to add functionality and features along with fixing or resolving any issues that may have previously existed. 

Machine Language: Binary
Assembly Language: Machine Dependent
High-level Language: Human Readable and Writeble


## What is a Program?
A program is a set or collection of statements or instructions that a computing device processes so that it can perform as designed.
