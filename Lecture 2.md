# Introduction to the Go Programming Language

## Why Go Language?
From a professional software engineer's perspective the Go Programming Language represents a natural progression for C-Like Programming Languages. It is a staticaly typed language that provides the rigor needed for modern computing environments. It was designed to have a more modern application programming interface and comes standard with a rich set of libraries. 

## Print and Println Methods
Go's Standard Libray provides a set of of built-in features that provide a range of capabilities. We will look at two functions that provide the programmer with the ability to print text to the standard output, which is typically a terminal or monitor. 

## Variables 
Variables are temporary locations in the computers memory. Memory is typically allocated as continguous blocks.

## Data Types
float, integers, and strings are all different types of data and require different amounts of storage as well as different means in access its values or locations within memory.

## Arithmetic Operators
+ - * /

## Combined Operators
+=, -=, *=, /=

## Creating Constants
## Scope
## Comments
