# Introduction to the Go Programming Language

## Why Go Language?
From a professional software engineer's perspective the Go Programming Language represents a natural progression for C-Like Programming Languages. It is a staticaly typed language that provides the rigor needed for modern computing environments. It was designed to have a more modern application programming interface and comes standard with a rich set of libraries. 

## Print and Println Methods
Go's Standard Libray provides a set of of built-in features that provide a range of capabilities. We will look at two functions that provide the programmer with the ability to print text to the standard output, which is typically a terminal or monitor. 

## Variables 
Variables are temporary locations in the computers memory. Memory is typically allocated as continguous blocks. 

When your program is called and executed it's the Operating System that loads your programs binary files, into its working memory, RAM. Random Access Memory is the primary location where all programs are run from. This includes the Operating System itself, any utilities, and all applications. This is why it is important to understand what your program is doing so that you do not inadvertently cause another program to stop working. 

A variable begins its definition with the 'var' keyword and a unique identifier. The unique identifier consisist of characters that can be either a letter or a digit. However, all indetifies must begin with a letter. 

As an example in our FahrenheitToCelsius.go program, we defined variables as 
'var fahrenheit, celsius int'

Each variable is defined by its datatype. A datatype defines and determines the kind of data that can be stored in a given memory location. The Operating System needs to understand how much memory to allocate to all variables being defined. 
	

In the computers volatile memory, RAM, your program will define 

32-bit computer
highest memory 0xFFFFFFFF
               [ memory ]
lowest memory  0x00000000 

Stacks Grow Down
Heaps Grow Up



That working data exists within the computers volatile memory. 

Storage
Volatile Memory: Random Access Memory

## Data Types
float, integers, and strings are all different types of data and require different amounts of storage as well as different means in access its values or locations within memory.

## Arithmetic Operators
+ - * /

## Combined Operators
+=, -=, *=, /=

## Creating Constants
## Scope
